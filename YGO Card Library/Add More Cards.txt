If you have any questions, please feel free to ask

This code can give details of cards from the Yu-Gi-Oh! TGC and card pictures.  Right now it only has cards from the LOB(Legend of Blue-Eyes White Dragon) expansion set.  I will add more sets when I finish typing them up.  You can also sort the cards by Normal, Effect, Fusion, Ritual (No cards available), Magic(Spell), and Trap.  I might add other sorting methods later.  As of now the program is complete. I have done a lot of testing to make sure there are no bugs.  If you discover a problem(bug), please feel free to let me know.  If you're feeling daring enough, you can add you own cards to the library. I have included instructions on how to do so.  The only 2 requirements are that you need to have RICHTX32.ocx and MSCOMCTL.ocx installed
