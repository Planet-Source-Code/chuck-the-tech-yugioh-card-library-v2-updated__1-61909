### Description

This code can give details of cards from the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG and card pictures. Right now it only has cards from the LOB(Legend of Blue-Eyes White Dragon) expansion set. I will add more sets when I finish typing them up. You can also sort the cards by Normal, Effect, Fusion, Ritual (No cards available), Magic(Spell), and Trap. I might add other sorting methods later. As of now the program is complete. I have done a lot of testing to make sure there are no bugs. If you discover a problem(bug), please feel free to let me know. If you're feeling daring enough, you can add you own cards to the library. I have included instructions on how to do so. The only 2 requirements are that you need to have RICHTX32.ocx and MSCOMCTL.ocx installed. Please post any feedback. Your feedback will make this a better program.

Now has Search Engine just like Yugioh Virtual Desktop.

Next to come, automatic alphabetical sorting.
